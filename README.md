# Teaching

This is just a repository, compiled with talks and lectures I gave during past years. Following material are available:

- [Pattern Recognition][pr] (series of practical sessions, in Russian): just some practical materials that I gave during my academic practice in University (as a part of my Master's degree) on traditional methods of Pattern Recognition. This can be thought of as practical complementary to [Prof. Klyushin Dmitry's lectures][klyushin-pr].
